	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?

	- Compress dungeon asset table on save by adding a lookup table and numeric indexes

	- Otter and broper beach party quest


	- Needed music
		- Tavern
		- Town
		- Battle
		- Forest
		- Dungeon

	- Bank system
		- Exchange
		- Store gold
		- Should be tied to the game itself, and needs to be requested by coop players (not sent by default due to size)
		- Monsters should be able to steal a percentage of your held gold

	- Custom cursors?

	Food for thought
		- Fast travel system
			- Expensive


Mod improvements:
	- Mod pagination once we have more than 50 mods


Deprecated:
	- Use IDs for rooms instead of indexes: You should just not add rooms to official dungeons since I may go back and add an overlapping room later.
