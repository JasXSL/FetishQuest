			And he won't allow just any riffraff to enter. The player is sent out to acquire royal swimwear. At the royal "armory".
		2. 	Since the prince took over, the royal armory is now only producing bikini armor with the royal seal of approval. In order to gain this armor they player must show proficiency with it.
