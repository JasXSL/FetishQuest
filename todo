-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system
	- Add more automatic asset unrolling as you discover rolled up assets

-- CURRENT --
	
	Things you need to unroll:
	- dungeonRooms -> encounters
	- quests -> objectives
	- quests -> rewards
	- texts -> conditions (a lot of grouped conditions) Many of these are duplicates. Might be able to convert them?
	- actions -> wrappers
	- actions -> riposte
	- conditions -> conditions - Subconditions. Might be able to run a duplication detect?
	- players -> assets
	- playerTemplates -> random_loot (Needs a new PlayerTemplateLoot library)
	- wrappers -> effects
	- encounters -> game_actions
	- encounters -> passives
	- encounters -> wrappers
	- gameActions -> conditions
	- actionLearnable -> conditions
	- questObjectives -> events
	- questObjectives -> visibilityConditions


	Things you can ignore:
	- audioKits -> *
	- hitfx -> *

	

// Detecting root level objects:
for( let i in mod.mod ){
    if( !Array.isArray(mod.mod[i]) || i === 'audioKits' || i === 'hitFX' )
        continue;

    for( let root of mod.mod[i] ){
        
        for( let n in root ){
            if( Array.isArray(root[n]) ){
                
                for( let obj of root[n] ){
                    
                    if( typeof obj === 'object' ){
                        console.log("Object detected", obj, "in", i, n);
                    }

                }


            }
        }
    }

}
	

-- LATER UPDATE --

	- Cache main mod in indexeddb until it's updated somehow

	- Procedural dungeon affixes

	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?
		- What do there?
	- Mini map

	- Books
	- West forest
		- Hidden path down to the beach
		- Otter and Broper show up there after completing their quest
			- What next?


	- Needed music
		- Tavern
		- Town
		- Battle
		- Forest
		- Dungeon

	- Bank system
		- Exchange
		- Store gold
		- Should be tied to the game itself, and needs to be requested by coop players (not sent by default due to size)
		- Monsters should be able to steal a percentage of your held gold

	- Custom cursors?
		- Arrow
		- Interact
		- Inspect
		- Buy
		- Sell
		- Repair


	Food for thought
		- Fast travel system
			- Expensive

	Monster ideas:
		- Slime monster


Mod improvements:
	- Mod pagination once we have more than 50 mods
