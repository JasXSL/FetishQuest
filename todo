	Main quest:
		Part 2:
		1. Travel to borm and talk to people.
		2. Kidnapped. After RP, clear the cave and find a scroll:
		3. Take scroll to cartographers and get sent to find a cipher.
		4. Do a dungeon to get the cipher.
		5. Get the scroll translated, and it turns out to be a summoning of a giant borm tentacle.
		6. Go back to Borm and fight the tentacle monster.
		7. The tentacle drops some kind of magic item that you take back to the guards and finish the quest.


		Part 3:
		1. 	In the throne room you're met by the king's servant KS. He tells the player that matters of importance are to be discussed in the Prince's personal spa. 
			And he won't allow just any riffraff to enter. The player is sent out to acquire royal swimwear. At the royal "armory".
		2. 	Since the prince took over, the royal armory is now only producing bikini armor with the royal seal of approval. In order to gain this armor they player must show proficiency with it.
			In order to gain this seal, the player must accomplish 2 tasks in the royal coliseum while wearing unsealed versions of the armor.
			The armor is enchanted to allow royalty to arouse the wearer.
		3.	Tasks:
			- Mental test: Hooks players up to a machine that arouses them if they answer wrong. The players lose if they answer too many questions wrong.
			- Physical Test: Arena fight. The prince will arouse the players through the swimwear.
				- Note: Add a way to prevent any disrobing during a fight, including by players.
				- Fight won't start until all players are wearing swimwear.
		4.	Talk to the prince, and he dismisses the notions. But grants you permission and a small stipend to go hunt down these cultists myself.


		Part 4:
		1.	Hunting down the first cultist

		Part 5:
		1. 	Hunting down the second cultist

		Part 6:
		???
