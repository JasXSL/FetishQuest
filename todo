-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system
	- Add more automatic asset unrolling as you discover rolled up assets

-- CURRENT --

	Haunted house quest:
		- Auntie Reven
			- Is a cougar
			- Is very fast
		- Quest to find out what is haunting the house
		- Quest starts with a person outside the house who is her nephew
		- Rewards an owometer?



-- TEST --
	Fast travel system
	Tailor quest
	Underwater procedural
	Mini map
	Anem'ogus quest
	Shark quest
	Tavern quest

	Bugs:
		- Force update log after finishing an exploration. Not sure what causes this, it should be set? Maybe game.proceduralDiscovery isn't updated correct?
		- I can tell your cock likes it when <- invalid start text. not sure what causes this
		

	Fun tensorflow generated words I can use:
		- Moinather - An item of some sort
		- Fabmaren 
		- Divantle
		- rubor chair
		- chaptence
		- procedo
		- treather
		- slimy rough sogle
		- demalline
		- tipten 
		- therrage 
		- Tworef 
		- Yuglow earthen
		- Scorbus
		- Fortiott Candifstem
		

-- LATER UPDATE --

	- Cache main mod in indexeddb until it's updated somehow

	- Procedural dungeon affixes

	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?
		- What do there?


	- Otter and broper beach party quest


	- Needed music
		- Tavern
		- Town
		- Battle
		- Forest
		- Dungeon

	- Bank system
		- Exchange
		- Store gold
		- Should be tied to the game itself, and needs to be requested by coop players (not sent by default due to size)
		- Monsters should be able to steal a percentage of your held gold

	- Custom cursors?
		- Arrow
		- Interact
		- Inspect
		- Buy
		- Sell
		- Repair


	Food for thought
		- Fast travel system
			- Expensive

	Monster ideas:
		- Slime monster


Mod improvements:
	- Mod pagination once we have more than 50 mods


Deprecated:
	- Use IDs for rooms instead of indexes: You should just not add rooms to official dungeons since I may go back and add an overlapping room later.
