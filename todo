		6. Go back to Borm and fight the tentacle monster.
		7. The tentacle drops some kind of magic item that you take back to the guards and finish the quest.


		Part 3:
		1. 	In the throne room you're met by the king's servant KS. He tells the player that matters of importance are to be discussed in the Prince's personal spa. 
			And he won't allow just any riffraff to enter. The player is sent out to acquire royal swimwear. At the royal "armory".
		2. 	Since the prince took over, the royal armory is now only producing bikini armor with the royal seal of approval. In order to gain this armor they player must show proficiency with it.
			In order to gain this seal, the player must accomplish 2 tasks in the royal coliseum while wearing unsealed versions of the armor.
			The armor is enchanted to allow royalty to arouse the wearer.
		3.	Tasks:
			- Mental test: Hooks players up to a machine that arouses them if they answer wrong. The players lose if they answer too many questions wrong.

				- Note: Add a way to prevent any disrobing during a fight, including by players.
				- Fight won't start until all players are wearing swimwear.
