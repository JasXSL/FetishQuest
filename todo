-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system
	- Add more automatic asset unrolling as you discover rolled up assets

-- CURRENT --

	- Make rebase automatic using static RELATIONS


	Tailor quest:
		- Add more outfit pieces
		- Add player dialog
		- Add mini dungeon

	Bugs:
		- Force update log after finishing an exploration. Not sure what causes this, it should be set? Maybe game.proceduralDiscovery isn't updated correct?
		- I can tell your cock likes it when <- invalid start text. not sure what causes this
		- Shops are auto generated immediately on netcode?
		

-- LATER UPDATE --

	- Cache main mod in indexeddb until it's updated somehow

	- Procedural dungeon affixes

	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?
		- What do there?
	- Mini map

	- Books
	- West forest
		- Hidden path down to the beach
		- Otter and Broper show up there after completing their quest
			- What next?


	- Needed music
		- Tavern
		- Town
		- Battle
		- Forest
		- Dungeon

	- Bank system
		- Exchange
		- Store gold
		- Should be tied to the game itself, and needs to be requested by coop players (not sent by default due to size)
		- Monsters should be able to steal a percentage of your held gold

	- Custom cursors?
		- Arrow
		- Interact
		- Inspect
		- Buy
		- Sell

	Food for thought
		- Fast travel system
			- Expensive

	Monster ideas:
		- Slime monster


Mod improvements:
	- Mod pagination once we have more than 50 mods


Deprecated:
	- Use IDs for rooms instead of indexes: You should just not add rooms to official dungeons since I may go back and add an overlapping room later.
