-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system
	- Add more automatic asset unrolling as you discover rolled up assets

Overhaul:
	Remove the primary stats
	Make AP regen a fixed 4 AP per turn.
	Keep MP regen as is.
	Make special stats such as crit.
	Lock potion belt during combat
	Max AP should be based purely on power
	Replace armor steal on wipe with a money steal.
	Add a bank.
	Can't change armor in combat, but you can re-equip a stripped piece.
	Scale the bon/sv importance based on level, so it's more important in the late game
	Improve enemy power distribution
	Allow players to mark groin/mouth/chest on players to set areas particles originate from.
	Lower max arousal to 6
	Ability swap out of combat
	Enable beneficial spells out of combat
	Max arousal removes all AP and cuts AP regen in half for 2 turns.
	Enemies that counter the niches (Should be given to certain types, to make less random of appearing). ex:
		- Counterattack a taunting player
		- Attack that can only be used on a player that was healed or did healing last turn
		- Attack that can only be used while knocked down/dazed.
		- Enemy becomes stronger when you remove its shell (affected by armor reduction). Or attack that does more damage while naked.
	Make the attack/arouse into one default attack ability, but allow players to spend 1 AP to switch it between the 3 damage types at any time.

	Combat stats:
	- Phys : The same
	- Corr : The same, but orgasm reworked
	- Arcane : Ignores 50% of enemy armor


	Niches:
	- Taunt. Also forces the target to use up all their AP if possible.
	- Arousal management.
	- Cast prevention (interrupt/silence/knockdown)
	- Armor removal.
	- Combo. Gain 1 combo point per 5 AP spent, max 6. Being hit by a detrimental action has a 10% chance per point to break the combo. Combo increases hit chance by 2% per point, and can be spent on actions.
	- Crowd control. Actions that stun for multiple rounds, but breaks on damage.
	

	Warrior (Phys) - Taunt
	Cleric (Arcane) - Arousal removal
	Elementlist (Arcane) - Cast prevention
	Rogue (Corr) - Armor removal
	Monk (Phys) - Combo/breaking
	Tentaclemancer (Corr) - Crowd control.

	Main quest:
		Part 2:
		1. Travel to borm and talk to people.
		2. Kidnapped. After RP, clear the cave and find a scroll:
		3. Take scroll to cartographers and get sent to find a cipher.
		4. Do a dungeon to get the cipher.
		5. Get the scroll translated, and it turns out to be a summoning of a giant borm tentacle.
		6. Go back to Borm and fight the tentacle monster.
		7. The tentacle drops some kind of magic item that you take back to the guards and finish the quest.


		Part 3:
		1. 	In the throne room you're met by the king's servant KS. He tells the player that matters of importance are to be discussed in the Prince's personal spa. 
			And he won't allow just any riffraff to enter. The player is sent out to acquire royal swimwear. At the royal "armory".
		2. 	Since the prince took over, the royal armory is now only producing bikini armor with the royal seal of approval. In order to gain this armor they player must show proficiency with it.
			In order to gain this seal, the player must accomplish 2 tasks in the royal coliseum while wearing unsealed versions of the armor.
			The armor is enchanted to allow royalty to arouse the wearer.
		3.	Tasks:
			- Mental test: Hooks players up to a machine that arouses them if they answer wrong. The players lose if they answer too many questions wrong.
			- Physical Test: Arena fight. The prince will arouse the players through the swimwear.
				- Note: Add a way to prevent any disrobing during a fight, including by players.
				- Fight won't start until all players are wearing swimwear.
		4.	Talk to the prince, and he dismisses the notions. But grants you permission and a small stipend to go hunt down these cultists myself.


		Part 4:
		1.	Hunting down the first cultist

		Part 5:
		1. 	Hunting down the second cultist

		Part 6:
		???	

	Side quests:
		- The borm straw tickle tentacles rise
			- Clear out the fields of borm from tickle tentacles



	Assets:
		- Horny bat. Deals 3 damage and lowers arousal by 3.


	Enchants:
		Fun enchants:

			- Soulbound: Prevents the armor from being stolen
			- 

	Action ideas:
		- Lustful Wind: Doubles your arousal and grants 2 AP per original point of arousal.
