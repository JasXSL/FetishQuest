-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system
	- Add more automatic asset unrolling as you discover rolled up assets

Overhaul:
	Test the boss fights
	Test changed actions
	Write more texts

	Warrior (Phys) - Taunt
	Cleric (Arcane) - Block
	Elementlist (Arcane) - Interrupts
	Rogue (Corr) - Armor removal
	Monk (Phys) - Grapples
	Tentaclemancer (Corr) - Arousal management 

	Ideas:
	- Enemy ability that does damage but removes arousal.
	- Enemy ability that can counter rogue armor removal somehow.


-- CURRENT --

	Tentacle Wrestling:
		- Figure out contenders
		
	Bugs:
		- Saving extensions still seem to brick the original objects for arrays?
		- Sometimes using repair kits fails?

	Items:
		- Sundial to tell the time outside


	Utility passives:
		- Exhibitionist: Taking on/off clothes in combat costs no AP.
		- Prone: 50% increased crit
		- Thrash: When dazed, get a cheap AoE
		- Takes no damage penalty from not wearing gear.
		- Add an extra action slot.



	Main quest:
		Part 2:
		1. Travel to borm and talk to people.
		2. Kidnapped. After RP, clear the cave and find a scroll:
		3. Take scroll to cartographers and get sent to find a cipher.
		4. Do a dungeon to get the cipher.
		5. Get the scroll translated, and it turns out to be a summoning of a giant borm tentacle.
		6. Go back to Borm and fight the tentacle monster.
		7. The tentacle drops some kind of magic item that you take back to the guards and finish the quest.


		Part 3:
		1. 	In the throne room you're met by the king's servant KS. He tells the player that matters of importance are to be discussed in the Prince's personal spa. 
			And he won't allow just any riffraff to enter. The player is sent out to acquire royal swimwear. At the royal "armory".
		2. 	Since the prince took over, the royal armory is now only producing bikini armor with the royal seal of approval. In order to gain this armor they player must show proficiency with it.
			In order to gain this seal, the player must accomplish 2 tasks in the royal coliseum while wearing unsealed versions of the armor.
			The armor is enchanted to allow royalty to arouse the wearer.
		3.	Tasks:
			- Mental test: Hooks players up to a machine that arouses them if they answer wrong. The players lose if they answer too many questions wrong.
			- Physical Test: Arena fight. The prince will arouse the players through the swimwear.
				- Note: Add a way to prevent any disrobing during a fight, including by players.
				- Fight won't start until all players are wearing swimwear.
		4.	Talk to the prince, and he dismisses the notions. But grants you permission and a small stipend to go hunt down these cultists myself.


		Part 4:
		1.	Hunting down the first cultist

		Part 5:
		1. 	Hunting down the second cultist

		Part 6:
		???	

	Side quests:
		- The borm straw tickle tentacles rise
			- Clear out the fields of borm from tickle tentacles



	Assets:
		- Horny bat. Deals 3 damage and lowers arousal by 3.


	Enchants:
		Fun enchants:
			- Vibrational: Heavy armor only. Reduces damage taken but vibrates when player is hit by physical actions, arousing.
			- Soulbound: Prevents the armor from being stolen
			- 

	Item ideas:
		- Motivation: Doubles your arousal and grants 2 AP per original point of arousal.
		- Sacrifice : Destroys a random piece of worn armor and restores 20 HP.

-- TEST --

-- Totally not stolen ideas --
	During boss and elite combats, gain 1 energy start of turn
	Increased loot
	AoE when playing multiple skills
	Chance to make a random ability cost no AP
	Give stats when debuffed
	Sets a min damage for attacks
	When you play x attacks in a turn, something happens
	Gain AP every x actions used in a battle
	Sorted effects like also deals x damage to the enemy with highest HP
	Bonus damage when conditions are met, such as highest HP enemy


-- LATER UPDATE --

	- Procedural dungeon affixes
	- Prodecural dungeon traps
	- Loading screen tips

	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?
		- What do there?

	- Compress dungeon asset table on save by adding a lookup table and numeric indexes

	- Otter and broper beach party quest


	- Needed music
		- Tavern
		- Town
		- Battle
		- Forest
		- Dungeon

	- Bank system
		- Exchange
		- Store gold
		- Should be tied to the game itself, and needs to be requested by coop players (not sent by default due to size)
		- Monsters should be able to steal a percentage of your held gold

	- Custom cursors?
		- Arrow
		- Interact
		- Inspect
		- Buy
		- Sell
		- Repair


	Food for thought
		- Fast travel system
			- Expensive

	Boss ideas:
		- Limits the nr of actions you can use per turn
		- 



Mod improvements:
	- Mod pagination once we have more than 50 mods


Deprecated:
	- Use IDs for rooms instead of indexes: You should just not add rooms to official dungeons since I may go back and add an overlapping room later.
