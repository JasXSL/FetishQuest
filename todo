-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system


- Need a game action that re-checks active players in the room for when the zebra leaves to go upstairs



-- CURRENT --
	- EDITOR:
		- Figure out how to do sub-encounters



Meshes:




Smol:	
	- Enabling or disabling a mod while hosting should send a full game








Medium rare:
	- Add fog override to cells
	- Character export/import
	- Special case npc markers for mimics
	
	x Sneak attack not showing as disabled when it should be on online coop
		- Test
	
-- LATER UPDATE --

	- Add hotkeys for combat

	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?
		- What do there?
		

	- Books
	- West forest
		- Hidden path down to the beach
		- Otter and Broper show up there after completing their quest
			- What next?


	- Needed music
		- Tavern
		- Town
		- Battle
		- Forest
		- Dungeon


	- Populate the bazaar
	- Show what mods a quest belongs to
	- Quest editor (later)
	- Game benefit for using a punishment (generic passive)
		- Sub = Restore mana
		- Dom = restore HP
		- 
	- Convert more stuff to the new modal system

	- Bank system
		- Exchange
		- Store gold
		- Should be tied to the game itself, and needs to be requested by coop players (not sent by default due to size)
		- Monsters should be able to steal a percentage of your held gold

	- Punishments
	- Custom cursors
		- Arrow
		- Interact
		- Inspect
		- Buy
		- Sell
		- Repair


	Food for thought
		- Fast travel system
			- Expensive

	Monster ideas:
		- Flytrap type tentacle monster that grapples a player's butt with its maw
		- Slime monster
		

	Action ideas:
		Chains : Cast on 2 targets, increasing all their AP costs by 1 for 3 turns.
