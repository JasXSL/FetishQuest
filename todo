-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system
	- Add more automatic asset unrolling as you discover rolled up assets

-- CURRENT --

	Add a group finder?

	Traps:
		- Make traps work like interactions in that they are removed when the item is first used

	Haunted house quest:
		- Snep outside tells you that the house is haunted, and asks you to figure out what's going on
		- Need to find an Enchantment-magic Field Reader, a book, and handprints
		- After doing so, the whole place will flicker and players will hide in a closet
		- Player leave and the snep tells you that it's his great aunt reven, a cougar who used to run a lot
		- Players go back in there and take her down to finish the quest
		- Quest reward: ???
		
	- Player markers occasionally double-spawn. Need more info.


-- TEST --

	Bugs:
		- Force update log after finishing an exploration. Not sure what causes this, it should be set? Maybe game.proceduralDiscovery isn't updated correct?
		- I can tell your cock likes it when <- invalid start text. not sure what causes this
		

	Fun tensorflow generated words I can use:
		- Moinather - An item of some sort
		- Fabmaren 
		- Divantle
		- rubor chair
		- chaptence
		- procedo
		- treather
		- slimy rough sogle
		- demalline
		- tipten 
		- therrage

-- LATER UPDATE --

	- Cache main mod in indexeddb until it's updated somehow

	- Procedural dungeon affixes

	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?
		- What do there?


	- Otter and broper beach party quest


	- Needed music
		- Tavern
		- Town
		- Battle
		- Forest
		- Dungeon

	- Bank system
		- Exchange
		- Store gold
		- Should be tied to the game itself, and needs to be requested by coop players (not sent by default due to size)
		- Monsters should be able to steal a percentage of your held gold

	- Custom cursors?
		- Arrow
		- Interact
		- Inspect
		- Buy
		- Sell
		- Repair


	Food for thought
		- Fast travel system
			- Expensive

	Monster ideas:
		- Slime monster


Mod improvements:
	- Mod pagination once we have more than 50 mods


Deprecated:
	- Use IDs for rooms instead of indexes: You should just not add rooms to official dungeons since I may go back and add an overlapping room later.
