UI Overhaul:
	- User inventory page
		- Netgame players should be able to destroy items
	- Don't send npc inventory to netcode players
	- Quest start and finish splash screens
	- Show what mods a quest belongs to

Generic code:
	- Assign party leader
	- The leader is the only one who can interact with doors (except escape)
	- NPC players should not be able to interact with anything
	- When a player dies, their equipped gear takes 20% durability damage
	- Redesign gear stats so it scales with level. Starting with enemies 3 levels above the item, all stats on an item starts being reduced by 1 point in checks.
	- Character export/import
	- (later) Redo netcode to send different types when they've changed

Mod Editor:
	- ModVars (later) - Custom data that can be set and read by conditions
	- Quest editor (later)

new Gameplay elements:
	- Learning/unlearning actions
	- Shops
	- Money
	
Action ideas:
	- Cleric: Sacrament of Sin: Free, 10 turn cooldown. Makes your healing abilities do damage for 1 turn, and increases their damage by 10% per point of arousal.



Dungeon design:
	- Players start in the port tavern. Make a port "dungeon":
		- Outdoor area
		- Shop
		- Tavern
		- Exit to world map



Large 3d Tasks:
	- Combat background
	- Particle effects on players

Audio tasks:
	- UI sounds
		- Generic click

Bugs:
	- Upon starting a new game, the loot bags that drop can't be clicked
	-
