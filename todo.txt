	- Players start in the port tavern. Make a port "dungeon":
		- Outdoor area
		- Shop
		- Tavern
		- Exit to world map

	- UI sounds
		- Generic click

LATER:
	- New game picker needs sprite character
	- Show what mods a quest belongs to
	- Quest editor (later)
	- ModVars (later) - Custom data that can be set and read by conditions
