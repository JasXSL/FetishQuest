Big chungi:
	- Add the sharktopus fight
	- New monster: Sharktopus
		- A gong is in the arena, each time it's hit: 
			- A minor enemy is spawned that does high damage but can easily be defeated
			- It gains a stack of reverb
			- At num_players stacks, the shark emerges and the gong is made invisible
		- Shark is invisible and will be limited to two attacks with high AP cost but can be used multiple times

		- When shark emerges, cooldown of submerge must be reactivated so it doesn't reset by player being slow to bring him up
		- You can find stones on the island weighing in at 500g and can be used multiple times in a turn for only 2 AP and do 1 damage with a 50% base hit chance
		- Shark can have some generic tentacle abilities

	- Island quest:
		- Kill the beast, and you collect a trophy.
		- Bring the trophy to the port tavern to finish the quest and get a nice chunk of money and alcohol.
