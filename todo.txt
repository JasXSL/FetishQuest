Big chungi:

	- Add the sharktopus fight

	- New monster: Sharktopus
		- 4 Gongs are in the arena, these are invisible other than when the sharktopus has dived
			- Gongs need to have a low resistance to everything
			- Gong needs to not take damage
			- When gong is hit by an ability, it gets a self buff for 2 turns
			- When all 4 have that buff, they hide and the shark appears
		- Shark is pacified until all 4 gongs are hit by a spell or ability
		- It submerges every 8-nr_players turns until all gongs are hit again.
		- When shark is active, gongs hide and get the hit buff removed
		- When shark is submerged, it can only use one of two attack abilities and will use that until it emerges
		- When shark emerges, cooldown of submerge is activated so it doesn't reset by player being slow
		- You can find stones on the island weighing in at 500g and can be used multiple times in a turn for only 2 AP and do 1 damage with a 50% hit chance
		- Shark can have some generic tentacle abilities
