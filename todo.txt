-- LATER UPDATE --

	- Main quest chapter 2
		- Go to Yuug capital?
		- What do there?

	- Give every modal its own screen instead of using the modal system
	- Books
	- Show NPCs on the map
		- The things that are on the character menu should show up on the map instead:
			- Talk to
			- Rent a room
			- Loot
			- Shop
			- Repair
			- Bank
			- Train

	- West forest
		- Hidden path down to the beach
		- Otter and Broper show up there after completing their quest

	- Capital



- Needed music
	- Tavern
	- Town
	- Battle
	- Forest
	- Dungeon



LATER:
	- Add fog override to cells
	- Enabling or disabling a mod while hosting should send a full game
	- Character export/import
	- Populate the bazaar
	- Show what mods a quest belongs to
	- Quest editor (later)
	- Game benefit for using a punishment (generic passive)
		- Sub = Restore mana
		- Dom = restore HP
		- 
	- Convert more stuff to the new modal system

- Bank system
	- Exchange
	- Store gold


- Punishments
- Custom cursors
	- Arrow

	- Inspect
	- Buy
	- Sell

Food for thought
	- Fast travel system
		- Expensive
