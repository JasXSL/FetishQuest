Action ideas:
	- Cleric: Sacrament of Sin: Free, 10 turn cooldown. Makes your healing abilities do damage for 1 turn, and increases their damage by 10% per point of arousal.

Dungeon design:
	- Players start in the port tavern. Make a port "dungeon":
		- Outdoor area
		- Shop
		- Tavern
		- Exit to world map
	

Audio tasks:
	- UI sounds
		- Generic click

LATER:
	- New game picker needs sprite character
	- Show what mods a quest belongs to
	- Quest editor (later)
	- ModVars (later) - Custom data that can be set and read by conditions
	- Character export/import
