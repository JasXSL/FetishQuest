Action ideas:
	- Tentaclemancer
		- Infusion: Adds mana to your target, but also arousal.
		- Grease: 1 MP, 0 AP, 3 turn CD. Reduces the AP cost of the target's next 3 actions by 2, but causes them to generate 1 arousal. Lasts 3 turns.
		- Slime Ward: 1 MP, 1 AP, 6 turn CD. Places a slime ward on your target for 3 turns. If the target reaches max arousal while warded, they regenerate 50% of their max HP and ignore the normal orgasm effects.

	- Generic
		- Pummel DONE
		- Something that removes arousal from yourself
		- ???

LATER:
	- Show what mods a quest belongs to
	- Quest editor (later)
	- Game benefit for using a punishment
		- Sub = Restore mana
		- Dom = restore HP
		- 
	

- Punishments
	- Custom cursors
		- Arrow
		- Interact
		- Inspect
		- Buy
		- Sell
		- Repair


Food for thought
	- Fast travel system
		- Expensive
