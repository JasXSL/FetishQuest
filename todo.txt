Needed other:
Smol:	
	- Punishments
	- Add loot to mimics
	- See if you can make sub-assets of a linked asset connect to root (so you can click doors anywhere, not just the root mesh)
	- Handle object key deletions by a "_DELETED_" flag or something


Medium rare:
	- Redesign errors to a try/catch system, that'll let netcode return errors as well
	- Netcode needs to be able to callback
	- Add a text filter for cloth damage by slot if possible
	- Armor repair shops


Big chungi:
	- Goblin boat quest
		- Add boat that shows up x days after completing the boat quest
		- Boat lets you travel to the middle of the lake.
		- From there you can also go west to the western part of the forest
	- West forest
		- Hidden path down to the beach
		- Otter and Broper quest

Food for thought
	- Fast travel system
		- Expensive
		- Need to unlock at an inn
