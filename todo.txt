UI Overhaul:
	- User inventory page
		- Netgame players should be able to destroy items
	- Items should only be able to be used in combat if they're on the toolbelt
	- Don't send NPC inventory to netcode players
	- Quest start and finish splash screens
	

- multiplayer
	- Decouple audio from text, and have it send audio packets to multiplayer
	- Send hitfx to multiplayer

Generic code:
	- Assign party leader
	- The leader is the only one who can interact with doors (except escape)
	- NPC players should not be able to interact with anything
	- When a player dies, their equipped gear takes 20% durability damage
	- Redesign gear stats so it scales with level. Starting with enemies 3 levels above the item, all stats on an item starts being reduced by 1 point in checks.
	- Character export/import
	- (later) Redo netcode to send different types when they've changed
	- 

new Gameplay elements:
	- Learning/unlearning actions
	- Shops
	- Money
	
Action ideas:
	- Cleric: Sacrament of Sin: Free, 10 turn cooldown. Makes your healing abilities do damage for 1 turn, and increases their damage by 10% per point of arousal.


Dungeon design:
	- Players start in the port tavern. Make a port "dungeon":
		- Outdoor area
		- Shop
		- Tavern
		- Exit to world map


Audio tasks:
	- UI sounds
		- Generic click


LATER:
	- Show what mods a quest belongs to
	- Quest editor (later)
	- ModVars (later) - Custom data that can be set and read by conditions
