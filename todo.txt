-- Permanent to keep an eye for --
	- Keep redesigning errors to a try/catch system


-- CURRENT --

Bugs:
	Players should not be able to click the party leader icon if not DM

Meshes:
	t Character portrait


Smol:	
	- Enabling or disabling a mod while hosting should send a full game

Medium rare:
	- Add fog override to cells
	- Character export/import
	
Big chungi:
	- Church quest
		- Rewards
			- Sacrament of Sin : Increases damage done by 5% per point of arousal for 1 turn and each action removes 1 corruption.
			- Holy Chain : Taunts a target for 2 turns and increases all their AP costs by 1.
			- Holy Rod : Small rod that can be picked up and grants +1 holy proficiency (purchasable at friendly)
			- Goldweave Thong : Golden thong that inceases holy proficiencty and corruption resist
			- Divine Scepter : Smites a demon or undead enemy, dealing damage and stunning for 1 turn.
		- Premise: The clerics have had one of theirs kidnapped. They have managed to track down and lock a demon in their cellar, but not been able to get it to talk.
		- Quest A: Getting the demon to talk
			- Fight the demon to force it to confess. He reveals the location of the cleric, but that you're much too weak to free him.
		- Quest B: The sewers
			- Clerics tell you about the Divine Scepter, a relic that was dropped down a well, and send you to collect it.
			- Find the well, and drop into it to enter the yuug sewers. <What monsters do you encounter there?>
			- Navigate the sewers and fight <boss?> to get the scepter, but it seems quite dull.
			- Take it back to the clerics, they restore its power and you get it as a reward.
		- Quest C: Freeing the cleric
			- Find a demonic rift located somewhere, enter it to enter a demonic dungeon.
			- Fight your way through and kill the boss to free the cleric.
			- Return to the church to get your rewards:
				- Gold
				- Spells for warrior/cleric
				- Divine Plate Thong : Golden Plate thong. Grants increased holy proficiency and corruption resist
	- Show NPCs on the map
		- Design a mesh
		- Cache these and hide them to speed up loading
		- The things that are on the character menu should show up on the map instead:
			- Talk to
			- Rent a room
			- Loot
			- Shop
			- Repair
			- Bank
			- Train
